## 6. FAQ / Troubleshooting
**App error?** Ensure `pip install -r requirements.txt` was run and Python 3.8+ is used.  
**Misaligned images?** Re‑check print‑area clicks in `coordinatemaker.html`.  
**Files don’t appear?** Confirm PNG/JPG/JPEG format and use drag‑and‑drop upload.  
**Add more bases/designs?** Unlimited — just upload more and map new areas.
